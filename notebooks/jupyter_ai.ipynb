    "Okay, I need to write a Python program that includes two functions: one for computing the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers and another that runs five test cases for this LCM function. Let's break down how I can approach this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I remember that the LCM of two numbers can be found using their greatest common divisor (GCD). The formula is LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b). So, I'll need a helper function to compute the GCD. Python's math module has a gcd function, but wait, isn't that only available in Python 3.5 and above? Oh right, so I can import it from math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but what if one of the numbers is zero? Because LCM is typically defined for positive integers. So maybe I should handle cases where either number is zero by returning zero, since the LCM of zero and any number is zero. But in Python's math.gcd, gcd(0, x) returns the absolute value of x if x isn't zero, but if both are zero, it's an error. Hmm.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the LCM function, I'll define a helper function using math.gcd. Then, I'll compute the product of a and b, divide by their GCD, but also handle cases where either is zero by returning zero immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, no: if both a and b are zero, then technically the LCM isn't defined, but in programming terms, maybe we can return 0 as well. So in the function, I'll first check if either a or b is zero; if yes, return 0. Otherwise, proceed with the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for the test cases. The user wants five test cases. I should pick some varied examples to cover different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LCM of 4 and 6: Expected 12.\n",
    "2. LCM of 5 and 15: Expected 15.\n",
    "3. Edge case where one number is zero, like 0 and 5: Should return 0.\n",
    "4. Another edge case with larger numbers, say 12 and 18: Their GCD is 6, so 12*18/6=36.\n",
    "5. What about co-prime numbers? Like 7 and 9: LCM should be 63.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but what if the inputs are negative? Since LCM is always non-negative, I can take absolute values of a and b before computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So putting it all together:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define lcm(a, b) function:\n",
    "- Handle if either a or b is zero.\n",
    "- Compute GCD using math.gcd, but since math.gcd returns positive integers, take absolute values.\n",
    "- Then compute (abs(a)*abs(b)) // gcd. Wait, no: the formula is |a*b| / GCD(a,b). But in code, it's (abs(a) * abs(b)) // gcd_value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, wait, but if a or b are zero, we return zero as per earlier step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for the test function:\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll create another function that runs these five tests. Maybe print each test case and its expected result, then call the LCM function and print the actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all into code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import math at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define lcm(a, b):\n",
    "    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(abs(a), abs(b))\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but what if both are zero? Then we return zero as well. That's acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the test function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_lcm():\n",
    "    print(\"Test Case 1:\", lcm(4,6)) # should be 12\n",
    "    print(\"Expected:12, Actual:\", result)\n",
    "    Wait no, better to compute each in a separate line and print expected vs actual. Alternatively, write assert statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but perhaps for clarity, it's better to have print statements showing the test cases and their results. So I can structure each test case as:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Test Case 1: LCM of 4 and 6\")\n",
    "expected = 12\n",
    "actual = lcm(4,6)\n",
    "print(f\"Expected: {expected}, Actual: {actual}\")\n",
    "if actual != expected:\n",
    "    print(\"Failed!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Passed!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "But maybe in the test function, I can loop through a list of tuples containing input pairs and their expected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, just write each test case separately with print statements to display the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, perhaps for brevity, since it's only five cases, I'll compute each and print them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "So putting it all together:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function lcm(a, b):\n",
    "    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(abs(a), abs(b))\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the test function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_lcm():\n",
    "    print(\"Test Case 1: LCM(4,6)\", lcm(4,6))\n",
    "    # and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but in the output provided earlier, the code didn't have the test function. It just had a series of print statements after defining the functions. So perhaps I can structure it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the lcm function, create a list of tuples with each test case's inputs and expected outputs, then loop through them to print.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, in the initial response, the code was:\n",
    "\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "def lcm(a, b):\n",
    "    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(abs(a), abs(b))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(lcm(4,6)) #12\n",
    "print(lcm(5,15)) #15\n",
    "print(lcm(0,5)) #0\n",
    "print(lcm(12,18)) #36\n",
    "print(lcm(7,9)) #63\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait no, in the initial response, it's just print statements without test cases as a function. So perhaps the user expects just to run these five tests by printing each result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe create a test_lcm() function that runs all five and prints whether they pass or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for simplicity, perhaps the code can include both functions: lcm and then test cases either via print statements or via an assert-based test function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but in the initial code provided as the solution, it's just:\n",
    "\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "def lcm(a, b):\n",
    "    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(abs(a), abs(b))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(lcm(4,6))\n",
    "print(lcm(5,15))\n",
    "print(lcm(0,5))\n",
    "print(lcm(12,18))\n",
    "print(lcm(7,9))\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait no, that's not correct because the print statements are outside any function, which is acceptable as they're at the module level.\n",
    "\n",
    "So putting it all together, that would be the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this should work. Testing each case:\n",
    "\n",
    "lcm(4,6) = 12: Correct.\n",
    "lcm(5,15)=15: Correct.\n",
    "lcm(0,5)=0: Correct.\n",
    "lcm(12,18)=36: Yes, because GCD is 6, 12*18=216 /6=36.\n",
    "lcm(7,9)=63: Since they're co-prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that should cover the test cases.\n",
